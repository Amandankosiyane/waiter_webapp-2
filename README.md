# waiter_webapp

This is a web application for my sister's coffee shop in town, she need it to help her schedule weekly waiter shifts.
Waiters can:
  - register
  - login
  - select days they can work
  - update the days they can work on
                  
My sister want to:
  - see how many waiters are available to work
  - see how many waiters are available to work
  - reset the data to use the system for a new week
  - She need 3 waiters for each day. Days for which there are enough waiters should be marked as green, days for which more waiters are needed still and days that are over subscribed should be highlighted accordingly.
